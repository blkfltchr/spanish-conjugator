# Spanish Conjugator
***Pitch:*** Help Spanish learners practice verb conjugations. Current product: conjugator.io.
Work with a real product - update an existing codebase and build new features.

***MVP:***
- Update styling so that the difficulty levels are clearer 
- Build a Postgres backend containing all available verb conjugations. Use this GitHub repo for the data: https://github.com/ghidinelli/fred-jehle-spanish-verbs
- Create an authentication system for students
- Implement a similar feature to the contribution graph in GitHub. Let students set a target number of conjugations per day. If they hit their target, update the contribution graph

***Stretch:***
- Student analytics. Show which verbs the user has got correct most and least frequently
- Integrate Stripe. Let users “donate a beer” 
- Advanced options page. Rather than picking a level from 1-7, let users pick and choose which tense, person, regular/irregular verb they would like to use
- Create a leaderboard of the record number of consecutive conjugations
- Add a second profile type: teachers. Let teachers see the progress of their students. Let teachers create homework assignments and send them to students. The teacher can then view whether the student has completed the homework or not
- Come up with a new feature idea and implement it! There's lots of room for creativity on this project :)
